# NavoVNASharp
Reverse engineered sources for the NanoVNASharp application

Added TDR python script from this [article](https://nuclearrambo.com/wordpress/accurately-measuring-cable-length-with-nanovna/)
just save a s1p file and the python script will kick off :)


# Common Goals I guess

Rewrite software interface
Build resources for forms


# Important.

I did not write this software, just reverse engineered it, because the sources do not appear to be available, and because the author only seems to post the binary on his google drive.
