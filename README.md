# NavoVNASharp
Reverse engineered sources for the NanoVNASharp application

Added TDR python script from this [article](https://nuclearrambo.com/wordpress/accurately-measuring-cable-length-with-nanovna/)
just save a s1p file and the python script will kick off :)


# Common Goals 

 - Build a cable length calculator, determine Velocity Factor by using the lenght of cable as input parameter.

 - Rewrite software interface

 - Build resources for forms


# Important.
